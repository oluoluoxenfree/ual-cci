# Session One

Let's get to it! I assume you have a github account already - you are reading this after all - so we can get started!

## Git and Github

[My workshop on git and github](https://github.com/oluoluoxenfree/learn-git) from Afrotech Fest 2018 covers most of the essential commands.

For today, all you **need** to understand is that Github is place to store code, and git is a program you use to interact with Github.

## Netlify

Today, you're going to get something live - aka available to visit on the web - straight away using Netlify. Netlify does all kinds of cool things, but today what we're going to use is the one click deploy function.

I'd recommend you use [this template](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-base-blog/) but feel free to explore if you feel confident!

You'll need to sign up for a Netlify account - I'm fairly sure it prompts you but I will show you on my account so you can see the steps first - tell it where to store the code (which repo, or repository). Then we wait. And then you have a site!
