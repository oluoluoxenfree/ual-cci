# Session One

Let's get to it! I assume you have a github account already - you are reading this after all - so we can get started!

## Git and Github

[My workshop on git and github](https://github.com/oluoluoxenfree/learn-git) from Afrotech Fest 2018 covers most of the essential commands.

For today, all you **need** to understand is that Github is place to store code, and git is a program you use to interact with Github.

## Netlify

Today, you're going to get something live - aka available to visit on the web - straight away using Netlify. Netlify does all kinds of cool things, but today what we're going to use is the one click deploy function.

I'd recommend you use [this template](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-base-blog/) but feel free to explore if you feel confident!

You'll need to sign up for a Netlify account - I'm fairly sure it prompts you but I will show you on my account so you can see the steps first - tell it where to store the code (which repo, or repository). Then we wait. And then you have a site!

### Editing your blog

You can either use the [web editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) or you can download your repo using git, and push the changes back up.

I will go over both options!

## Web Accessibility

Web accessibility refers to making the web usable for people with disabilities, neurodiverse people and people with other access needs.

If you're using Chrome or Firefox, there are tools that you can download to check basic web accessibility problems with your site. I'd recommend [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/).

This template unfortunately has an issue already; can you tell me what it is? Can you fix it?
