# Hello world!

Hello everyone, good news!

I'm Olu (they/them), and I'll be running this for the next few Mondays!

I have worked at a few 'names' (BT/BBC/Financial Times) and currently freelance for a few wonderful organisations, mostly in Javascript.

This workshop is entirely flexible; if you feel like you need more time or less time on certain topics, we'll work around the group. There are no silly questions.

## Hello UAL CCI!

This course will take you through the basics of building a portfolio site. For artists an essential; for coders it's often _seen_ as an essential (we can argue about this later). We will also discuss topics that come up when building for the web, both ethical and technical.

## Okay, let's get to it!

### [Session one](session-one.md) will cover:

Why or why not?                           | Do you like this tool? Why? Why not? Does making it this easy to make a website make you feel more or less confident about using the web?
