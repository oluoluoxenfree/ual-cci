 Hello world!

Hello everyone, good news! I'm Olu (they/them), and I'll be running this for the next few Mondays!

I have worked at a few 'names' (BT/BBC/Financial Times) and currently freelance for a few wondeful organisations, mostly in Javascript.

## Hello UAL CCI!

This course will take you through the basics of building a portfolio site. For artists an essential; for coders it's often seen as an essential (we can argue about this later).
