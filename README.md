# Hello world!

Hello everyone, good news!

I'm Olu (they/them), and I'll be running this for the next few Mondays!

I have worked at a few 'names' (BT/BBC/Financial Times) and currently freelance for a few wonderful organisations, mostly in Javascript.

This workshop is entirely flexible; if you feel like you need more time or less time on certain topics, we'll work around the group. There are no silly questions.

## Hello UAL CCI!

This course will take you through the basics of building a portfolio site. For artists an essential; for coders it's often _seen_ as an essential (we can argue about this later). We will also discuss topics that come up when building for the web, both ethical and technical.

## Okay, let's get to it!

### [Session one](session-one.md) will cover:

Why? What impact would you choice have on the user base/employees/etc? Is it even possible to be sure? |
| How to use netlify to get something live as quickly as possible  | Edit the template you have chosen to use for a website. Make it your own. Is it difficult? Why or why not?                           | Do you like this tool? Why? Why not? Does making it this easy to make a website make you feel more or less confident about using the web? Why?                          |
| What web accessibility is & how to incorporate it into your work | How to incorporate web accessibility from the very beginning of your work                                                            | Research how much of the web is inaccessible.

| Understand why software licenses are important                   | Decide what license - or lack thereof - you would put on any software you made.

| basic HTML layout, and where to find inspiration                 | time, skill and monetary constraints change the look and feel of websites; no one has infinite time. does this change how you build? | Given constraints, what are the most important things to you to ensure a site has?

### [Session Two](session-two.md) will cover:

Javascript!

| Things to learn                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Javascript vocabulary - variables, arrays vs. objects, loops, functions... |
| Know what vanilla JS is (what does importing code mean?)                         |
| Try out a lot of different parts of VanillaJS                                    |

there are a lot of ways of achieiving the same thing in js!!
_example driven_

- explain coding context - set up and run a piece of example code
  **half hour per section**
- variables
- conditionals (if, else), prints odd and even
- loops (whichever syntax is easiest - there are others)
- functions (returns true or false if the number is odd or even)
- arrays and objects - loop over arrays and interact with an example object (address book using an array of objects). purpose is to model data. address with one or two lines
- method syntax - function on address book (address.HasTwoLines)
  - method has access to `this`
  - `undefined`
- javascript module - (import, require) "each module is similar to a file". import a file with defs in
  - mention there are many syntaxes (reference! MDN)
  - make particular reference to require syntax
  - npm! centralised rporistiry of modules

### [Session Three](session-three.md) will cover:

Even more Javascript!
