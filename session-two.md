# Session Two

We'll be using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), git, HTML and CSS to get something live today.

If you don't already have them, we'll be downloading a terminal and a text editor for you to use today.

I recommend using the terminal that comes with Macs & Linux, and can make recommednations if you are on Windows. For a text editor VSCode is the simplest option, in my humble but opinionated opinion.
