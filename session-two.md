# Session Two

There are a lot of ways of achieving the same thing in js!!

This workshop is _example driven_, meaning I'll try my best not to just talk at you, but to leave you to try things in your own time.

Things to be covered:

- explain coding context - set up and run a piece of example code

**half hour per section**

- variables ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables))

- conditionals (if, else), prints odd and even ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals))

- loops (whichever syntax is easiest - there are others) ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code))

- functions (returns true or false if the number is odd or even) ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions))

- arrays and objects - loop over arrays and interact with an example object (address book using an array of objects). purpose is to model data. address with one or two lines ([Arrays on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays) and [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics))

- method syntax - function on address book (address.HasTwoLines)

  - method has access to `this`

  - `undefined`

- javascript module - (import, require) "each module is similar to a file". import a file with defs in

  - mention there are many syntaxes ([MDN explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules))

  - make particular reference to require syntax

- npm! centralised repository of modules
